###  Hi, Iâ€™m Cheryl! After a successful career as a hairstylist and salon owner, I decided it was time for a new challengeâ€”one that lets me solve puzzles and build things in a whole new way. I recently graduated from Tech Elevator and am now diving into the world of software development with the same creativity, adaptability, and problem-solving mindset that made me successful in my first career.

One of my biggest strengths has always been my ability to connect with peopleâ€”whether itâ€™s understanding a clientâ€™s vision or collaborating on a team. I love writing code, but I also love communicating ideas clearly, working with others, and creating solutions that make an impact.

What Iâ€™m working on:

Sharpening my skills in Java, Spring Boot, SQL, JavaScript, and React
Building projects that are both functional and user-friendly
Learning, growing, and embracing every challenge along the way
Always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and great conversationsâ€”letâ€™s connect!
